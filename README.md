Cloud Automation Deployment 
Overview
This project automates the deployment of a static HTML/CSS website on AWS EC2 using Infrastructure as Code and containerization tools. It demonstrates DevOps best practices using Terraform for provisioning, Ansible for configuration, and Docker for application deployment.
Tools & Technologies Used
Tool/Service	Purpose
Terraform	
Provision AWS EC2 instance & networking
Ansible	Configure the EC2 server and install Docker
Docker	Containerize and run the sample web app
GitHub Actions	Automate CI/CD workflow for deployment
AWS EC2	Cloud infrastructure
VS Code / WSL2	Local development environment

Project Structure
Path/File	Description
terraform/	Terraform scripts (main.tf, key.tf, etc.)
ansible/	Ansible playbooks and inventory file
static-site/	Dockerfile and HTML/CSS web page
.github/workflows/	GitHub Actions pipeline (deploy.yml)
README.md	Documentation and setup instructions


Setup Instructions
Part 1: Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform
1.	Clone the GitHub Repository:
git clone https://github.com/shubh2220/Cloud.git
cd project
2.	Configure AWS credentials in your environment or via AWS CLI.
3.	Initialize and deploy with Terraform:  Refering main.tf and security_group.tf  to run :-
      terraform init 
terraform validate 
terraform plan 
terraform apply
4.	Confirm to create EC2 instance and output the public IP.
Part 2: Server Configuration with Ansible
1.	Installation of Ansible by 
     	sudo apt install ansible -y

2.	Update inventory.ini with the correct EC2 public IP.
	nano inventory.ini

3.	Run the Ansible Playbook:
	ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini install_docker.yml
4.	Docker is installed and started on boot.

Part 3: Docker Container Deployment
1.	Move into static-site/ directory: Contains your Dockerfile and index.html (HTML/CSS combined)
2.	Upload the static-site folder to EC2:
	scp -i /.ssh/First_Key.pem -r ./static-site ubuntu@3.250.99.137:/
3.	SSH into EC2:
	ssh -i ~/.ssh/First_Key.pem ubuntu@3.250.99.137
4.	Build and run Docker container:
	docker build -t static-site ./static-site
	docker run -d -p 80:80 static-site
5.	Visit  http://3.250.99.137  to view the webpage.
Part 4: CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions 
CI/CD automation has been implemented using GitHub Actions:
•	Workflow file: .github/workflows/deploy.yml
•	Trigger: Automatically runs on push to main branch.
•	Steps:
o	Checkout code
o	Build Docker image by using command
      docker images
o	Deploy to EC2 via SSH
This ensures every code update to the repo is tested, built, and deployed automatically to the cloud environment.
Final Deliverables
•	Terraform scripts
•	Ansible playbook
•	Dockerfile and web app
•	GitHub Actions workflow
•	Functional public web app (on EC2)
•	GitHub repository with README
•	Screenshots and architecture diagram in report
